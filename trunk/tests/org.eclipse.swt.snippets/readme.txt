This project is just the snapshot of org.eclipse.swt.snippet
at dev.eclipse.org version of December 2005.

It is not updated because many snippets about 3.2 new features
are added, which is not for the our current goal for support
SWT 3.1. Later when we setup our goal for SWT 3.2, we will
update the snippets.
