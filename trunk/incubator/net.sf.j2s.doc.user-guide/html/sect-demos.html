      <a class="ulink" href="http://demo.java2script.org/gtalk/" target="_top">Google Talk Client in Java2Script</a>.&nbsp;</b><a class="ulink" href="http://demo.java2script.org/gtalk/" target="_top">Google Talk Client in Java2Script</a> is a pure JavaScript copy of Google Talk Client from non-Google communities. It is first implemented 
      in Java language using Eclipse SWT and Smack (A library for Jabber's XMPP). Then the client is converted to 
      JavaScript with servlet supports. And then it's deployed on a Tomcat server. As Java being platform-independent, 
      and JavaScript is browser-independent, this Google Talk client runs in any modern browsers, such as Firefox, Opera, 
      and Internet Explorer (IE), on Windows, Linux, Mac and others OS platforms. For more details or architectural information, 
      please visit blog "Inside Java2Script".</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="WeMail Web Mail Client"><b>
