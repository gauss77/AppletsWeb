    so all created objects are valid java objects. Normally this is fine because you don't have to worry
    about javascript objects that are not valid java objects. </p><p>Nevertheless, in some situations, this default behaviour is not desiderable. For example, 
    if you want to integrate your J2S application with a 3rd party javascript toolkit, there can be compatibilities issues because some 
    javascript toolkits simply don't work with a modified Object.prototype. More, since all javascript objects
    contains java.lang.Object methods, it is impossible to create a clean javascript object, something really 
    common and required for working with 3rd party javascript toolkits. </p><p>Fortunately J2S supports a "native object" mode, in which javascript Object.prototype is not contaminated</p><p>explain the problems with native objects and explain j2s.native mode</p></div></body></html>
